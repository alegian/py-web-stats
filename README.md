# py-web-stats
This is a project I created as an optional assignement for my studies. It is written in python. When ran, it is supposed to download some publicly available data and extract specific statistical results from them and then exports the "important" data to CSV and to an existing SQL database. The python code is left simple on purpose, and expects a DB connection at `mysql://admin@127.0.0.1:3306/python-project`.

## Disclaimer
I do not own the URLs providing the raw data, and they could stop functioning at any given time, making this program crash.
